Overal Current Focus
## Emulate ARM7TDMI CPU
* Be able to disassemble each instruciton in 32 bit ARM mode, and 16 bit THUMB mode
* Execute each instruction and modify each register accordingly

# Plan
* Focus on getting a correct disassembler for the ARM7TDMI ARM MODE
* Start implementing 16 bit THUMB Mode disassemble (should be simpler)

## Todo
[x] Disassemble ARM7TDMI ARM Mode
[] Disassemble AMR7TDMI THUMB Mode
